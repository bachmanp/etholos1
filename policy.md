Any transactions generated via the Patient Identifier will be enforced via policy through the entire Identity Ecosystem.
The minimal requirements are detailed below.

This is possible by building soverign identity linked to PKI in a manner where patient identity information is governed by Fair Information Principles as definable computer enforced  Policy which scales up to International Agreements, to National Governments, to States, Organizations, and Individuals. 

This is built into the exchange of data relating to Patient Identity.

These fair practices are essential to the continued economic success of the US. 

Current costs for healthcare (18% of GDP) exceed the ability of people to pay. 

We should be getting a discount, we are paying a premium. Patient driven solutions are logical since the issue of trust of patient data, with the patient is easily scalable, but patient data within organizations is difficult.

Fraud, waste, abuse and duplicative overhead makeup 30% of the  healthcare portion of the entire GDP (18%).

This is with measurably worse patient outcomes, (as measured by the OECD relative to other countries) there is a great deal of room for economic disintermediation, while still allowing for reasonable profit for patient valued services. This is all based on voluntary consent. Above all, it is a rational development, that exists in many other countries.

Specifically through the following measures:

1. Lower demand for expensive health care procedures by giving patients better feedback to reach acheivable and appropriate near term medical goals by the use of clinical evidence, before reaching a chronic status.

That evidence leading to doctor-patient decision making, supported by electronic medical records, and the normalization of patient data for research purposes. 

For example, with effective Patient Identity with privacy safeguards, precision medicine can be negotiated by patients, (without using third parties to share), and thus profit by their genetic data. Several use cases excercising the policy will be detailed.

The current entire US healthcare system pushes people into chronic health conditions that are expensive as part of a fee for service payment system. While many of these issues do not require Patient Identity to be solved, medical errors based on identity are clearly a concern. 

Costs for the historical system were hidden from end users via employer health plans, which were an accident of WWII planning which froze wages. There is no simple way to compare health costs.

The perforance health outcomes are measured in the OECD data. Life expectancy in the US is currently going down.This is large scale systemic failure. It is also related to the Opiod crisis.

Directly the result of complex systemic problems that in turn impact individual patients and their families when it comes to healthcare services, the coordination of those services, while other services engineered by modern software engineers benefit from a number of new technologies, often delivered in the Cloud.

Essentially we pay more for services that deliver worse outcomes compared to countries that pay less, (even down to 9%). The difference is the lack of an integrated healthcare system based on the profit incentive.

2. Provide US specific services defined by Hl7 tailored to the US Realm, i.e. delivered via the Internet, but with US policy.

HHS was tasked with dealing with this in 2004. By leveraging the secure exchange of medical records over the Internet. HHS ONC took this as a mandate to explore how existing business interests could be protected from disintermediation. Primarily this is due to scale. 

3. Use Open Systems standards which are the legal back up standards to the Internet RFC

Open Systems have the ability to scale to entire countries. Data is held by various stakeholders, but made available to anyone in the distributed system that can prove a valid reason (defined by policy) to access that data. Right now the patient has very little say in how their healthcare data is used. By putting the patient in the driver's seat, literally making them a functional part of the system, they gain the benefits of an open system. 

4. Lowering costs via better health outcomes

By effectively sharing data on risks to patients, in which patients self-identify, risks that are well known can be pre populated to structured data that can be shared with providers in order to acheive effective decision making. While these FIPPs are primarily targeted to organizations, the nature of the patient identifier is that they will also apply to individuals to counter the threat of sibyl (false synthetic identity) attacks that drain healthcare resources. Correspondingly, digital signing and encryption of documents is supported, and will be explored in depth in the requirements matrix.


The Fair Information Practice Principles (from NSTIC)

To truly enhance privacy in the conduct of online transactions, the Fair Information Practice Principles 
(FIPPs) must be universally and consistently adopted and applied in the Identity Ecosystem 
 
The FIPPs are the widely accepted framework of defining principles to be used in the evaluation and consideration 
of systems, processes, or programs that affect individual privacy
 
In brief, the Fair Information Practice Principles are:

Transparency:
 Organizations should be transparent and notify individuals regarding collection, 
use, dissemination, and maintenance of personally identifiable information (PII) 

Individual Participation:
 Organizations should involve the individual in the process of using 
PII and, to the extent practicable, seek individual consent for the collection, use, dissemination, 
and maintenance of PII 
 Organizations should also provide mechanisms for appropriate access, 
correction, and redress regarding use of PII  

Purpose Specification:
 Organizations should specifically articulate the authority that permits 
the collection of PII and specifically articulate the purpose or purposes for which the PII is 
intended to be used

Data Minimization:
 Organizations should only collect PII that is directly relevant and necessary 
to accomplish the specified purpose(s) and only retain PII for as long as is necessary to fulfill the 
specified purpose(s)  

Use Limitation:
 Organizations should use PII solely for the purpose(s) specified in the notice
Sharing PII should be for a purpose compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected

Data Quality and Integrity:
 Organizations should, to the extent practicable, ensure that PII is 
accurate, relevant, timely, and complete

Security:
 Organizations should protect PII (in all media) through appropriate security safeguards 
against risks such as loss, unauthorized access or use, destruction, modification, or unintended 
or inappropriate disclosure

Accountability and Auditing:
 Organizations should be accountable for complying with these 
principles, providing training to all employees and contractors who use PII, and auditing the 
actual use of PII to demonstrate compliance with these principles and all applicable privacy 
protection requirements
Universal application of the FIPPs provides the basis for confidence and trust in online transactions
