This is an initial commit for the X.509v3/X.500 c=US Healthcare identity and informatics Directory. While the "Directory" and related PKI is well established, is a critical (if not well understood) part of network infrastructure, and thushas been extensively tested, and documented in security realms; this particular repository will focus on generating soverign patient identity using experimental protocols funded by recent research at Department of Homeland Security to develop "soverign identity" with DKMS. 

The point is to augment the quality and depth of the current PKI under c=US, or country equals US, for which I have been a manager and developer since the 1990s. There are a number of related efforts which I will list here to improve the PKI for the end user.
